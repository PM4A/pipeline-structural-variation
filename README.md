# pipeline-structural-variation

### Overview

Brief description in non-slang, explicit terms that facilitate the biological understanding of the data analysis provided by the software. Few sentences. Include biological concepts if appliable. **Link out to ReadtheDocs** specific to the repository and a explanation for further information see, `here <https://readthedocs.org/>`_

### Features

Bullet point the features that distinguish it from pre-existing or similar software, what advances have been made and how it enables the user to get what they want from the sequence data.

- Feature 1.
- Feature 2.
- Feature ...n

******************

# Getting Started

Describe a succint 101 on how to install, run and get software going.

### Input and Output

Details on sequence structure e.g. fast5, unaligned, ccs-like equivalent for ONT, raw data, capital/lower case, named, ordered, barcoded etc. Details on output structure of file and sequence and any formats that may apply - can these be reinserted into subsequent software for refinement etc.? 

### Dependencies

Software/hardware/usage depedencies

### Installation

Describe the stages necessary for installing software on various platforms/OS etc. exporting/importing files, how to run/where to run in which software/browswer etc.

#### Compilation From Source

Building the environment and compiling the software/pipeline/api/tool etc. from source

#### Alternative Installation Methods

Any other installation method.

### Usage: 

Per tool there should be

#### "Tool Name" (A)

A1. Coded Help messages

A2. Examples of code parametes and runs

#### "Tool Name" (B)

B1. Coded Help messages

B2. Examples of code parametes and runs

### Statistics and Performance

What statistics can be derived and what characterise the software i.e. false neg, false pos, what statistics models are used; boil down to hard numbers of reliability. From pacbio website: 'Performance is measured as positive predictive value (PPV); it measures TP/(TP+FP), the ratio of true positive calls over all true and false positive calls.' Describe using diagrams, tables, pictures of how to quantify a good and a bad performance...

### Data and Results

What values assess the data quality and how are these represented; explain. - **ANALYSIS** covered here

### FAQs

Description of generalities of the software and user experience misunderstandings. Ref any dialogue between customer and technical services/ONT too.

### Abbreviations

Tabulate abbreviations or names or shortened text or bioinformatician terms that the biologist might not understand... remember we are trying facilitate the users' experience of the product.

### References and Supporting Information

List helpful websites, pages on the community, papers, white papers, citations and relevant internal evidence thatt might help the user.
At a very minimum a link to the BIOINFORMATICS RESOURCE IN THE COMMUNITY - IN KNOWLEDGE should be used.

#### Research Release

Research releases are provided as technology demonstrators to provide early access to features or stimulate Community development of tools. Support for this software will be minimal and is only provided directly by the developers. Feature requests, improvements, and discussions are welcome and can be implemented by forking and pull requests. However much as we would like to rectify every issue and piece of feedback users may have, the developers may have limited resource for support of this software. Research releases may be unstable and subject to rapid iteration by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

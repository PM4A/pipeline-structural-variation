# pipeline-structural-variation

### Overview

`pipeline-structural-variation` is a pipeline for calling structural variations for whole genome sequencing Oxford Nanopore data. It accepts FASTQ files and outputs aligned reads and filtered SV calls.

### Features
The pipeline performs the following steps: 
- Maps reads using minimap2
- Produces QC report using NanoPlot
- Estimates appropriate parameters for variant calling depending on input coverage
- Calls variants using sniffles
- Filters variants

******************

# Getting Started

### Dependencies

To run the pipeline the following software packages have to be installed on your system:
- [miniconda3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) - install it according to the [instructions](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html).
- [snakemake](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/snakemake) install using `conda` as follows:
```bash
$ conda install -y snakemake
```
Alternatively, you can run the pipeline using [docker](https://www.docker.com/). In this case only a working docker installation is required (see alternative installation methods).
### Installation

After installing miniconda3 and snakemake (see above), install the pipeline as follows:
```bash
# Get pipeline
$ wget -O pipeline-structural-variation.tar.gz  https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-structural-variation/archive/v1.2.0.tar.gz
# Unzip
$ tar xvzf pipeline-structural-variation.tar.gz
# Change to directory
$ cd pipeline-structural-variation-* 
# To test if the installation worked run
$ snakemake --use-conda  -p all
```
When run for the first time snakemake will automatically set up the required conda environment and install all necessary tools. Depending on hardware and connection speed this might take up to 10-20 min.

### Input

To run the pipeline the following input files are required:

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Reference genome | FASTA file containing the reference genome (e.g. GRCh38 for human) |
| Nanopore reads| Folder containing FASTQ files or a single concatenated FASTQ file. Reads should be **q-scores filtered** (see FAQ)|

### Output

The main output files created by the pipeline are:

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Aligned reads | Aligned reads in indexed and sorted BAM format |
| Variant calls | Called variants in VCF format |

After the pipeline finished you can find the aligned reads in `{output_folder}/alignment/` and the indexed and zipped VCF file in `output_folder/sv_calls/{sample_name}_sniffles_filtered.vcf`.

### Usage: 

To run the pipeline with default settings invoke snakemake as follows.
```bash
$ snakemake -j 30 all --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa
```
`-j` specifies how many CPU cores will be used by the pipeline. `all` is the default target (see Targets) and will run all steps required for SV calling and produce a QC report for the input reads using NanoPlot. `input_fastq` specifies the input FASTQ files or a folder containing multiple input FASTQ files (e.g. the pass folder from Minkow).


### Alternative installation methods
#### Run using docker

To avoid installing *conda* on your system you can run the pipeline using docker. The only requirement is a working docker installation on your system. First build the docker image:
```bash
$ make build
```
Next, run pipeline as follows:
```bash
docker run -ti -w `pwd` -v `pwd`:`pwd` pipeline-structural-variation snakemake all
```
#### Setup conda environment manually

If you want to setup your conda environment manually follow the instructions below, activate the "environment" before running snakemake and skip the `--use-conda` parameter.

```bash
# Get pipeline
$ git clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-structural-variation.git
# Unzip
# Create conda environment
$ conda env create -n pipeline-structural-variation -f env.yml
# Activate environment
$ conda activate pipeline-structural-variation
# To test if the installation worked run (don't use --use-conda)
$ snakemake -p all
# Deactivate environment
$ conda deactivate
```

### Targets

|Name| Description |
|--|--|
| all | Maps reads, calls variants and produces a QC report from the input reads |
| qc | Only maps reads and produces a QC report |
| call | Maps reads and calls variants but does not produces QC report |
| eval | Evaluates the called variants against the GIAB truth set **only applicable when sequencing [HG002](https://www.coriell.org/0/Sections/Search/Sample_Detail.aspx?Ref=NA24385&Product=DNA) |

### Options

The pipeline accepts several input parameters. They can either be changed in the `config.yml` (see below) file ore specified when running snakemake.
For example:
```bash
snakemake -j 30 eval --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa min_sv_length=100
``` 
In the above example the minimum SV length parameters was changed to 100 bp.
##### Required parameters

These parameters have to be specified to run the pipeline.

| Parameter | Allowed | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| input_fastq | Absolute file path | FASTQ file or folder containing FASTQ files |
| reference_fasta | Absolute file path | FASTA file containing the reference genome |

##### Optional parameters

| Parameter | Allowed | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| sample_name | string without spaces | my_sample | Name of the sample |
| min_sv_length | Integer > 40 | 50 | Minimum SV length | 
| max_sv_length | Integer | 1000000 | Maximum SV length | 
| min_read_length | Integer | 1000 | Min read length. Shorter reads will be ignored |
| min_read_mapping_quality | Integer | 10 | Min mapping quality. Reads will lower mapping quality will be discarded |
| min_read_support | Integer | 'auto' | Minimum read support required to call a SV (auto for auto-detect) |


# What to do with the results?

## Annotate

This step will become part of the pipeline in the future. Currently, use tools like `bedtools` or `vcfanno` to annotate the VCF file with information about genes, repeats, known SV etc. from GTF/GFF/BED files.
There are many ways to retrieve annotations. A few examples are:
- [UCSC genome browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables) 
- [ENSEMBL](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)
- [GENCODE](https://www.gencodegenes.org/)

# Results

### Statistics and Performance

What statistics can be derived and what characterise the software i.e. false neg, false pos, what statistics models are used; boil down to hard numbers of reliability. From pacbio website: 'Performance is measured as positive predictive value (PPV); it measures TP/(TP+FP), the ratio of true positive calls over all true and false positive calls.' Describe using diagrams, tables, pictures of how to quantify a good and a bad performance...

### FAQs

**I only want my results! What should I do?**

Install pipeline (see Installation) and run as follows. 
```bash
$ snakemake -j 16 all --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa
```
You will find your results in the following locations:
**Aligned reads:**
```results/my_samples/alignment/my_sample_minimap2.bam```
**Variant calls:**
```results/my_samples/sv_calls/my_sample_sniffles_filtered.vcf.gz```

**What kind of structural variants are supported?**

Currently the pipeline has been validate for detection insertions, deletions and duplications from whole genome sequencing data. Support for inversions and translocation will be added in the future.  

**What is the minimum SV length supported?**

Currently, 50 bp.

**How can i filter my reads by q-scores?**

Most recent version of Minknow will perform filtering automatically. When using the FASTQ files from the `pass` output folder no additional filtering is required. For unfiltered datasets use [NanoFilt](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanofilt) with a minimum q-score of 6.

**How long will it take to run the pipeline for a 30X human dataset?**

When running with 30 CPU cores roughly 6-8 hours.

**How much memory will I need?**

Memory consumption is determined by minimap2. Therefore, 16 GB will be required for human datasets. For smaller genomes 8 GB will be sufficient. 

**How much storage will I need?**

Unzipped FASTQ files for a human 30X human dataset will require roughly 200 GB. In addition 150 GB will be required for the mapped BAM files.  

**Are FAST5 files required to run the pipeline?**

No

**Can I use the pipeline to detect variants in a cancer dataset or to detect somatic variants?**

The pipeline has not yet been validated on cancer samples or for somatic variant detection.

**Can I use the pipeline to detect SVs for targeted sequencing experiments (e.g. long amplicons, etc.)?**

Calling variants in targeted regions is support but requires the user to specify a bed file containing the coordinates of the targeted regions.
For example save the following in a file called `targets.bed`
```
chr1    6579767 6589767
```
and run pipeline as follows:
```bash
snakemake -j 30 eval --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa target_bed=targets.bed
```
Make sure that the chromosome names in the BED file match the names in your reference FASTA files (e.g. chr1 vs. 1)

**Can I use this pipeline to detect gene fusion using DNA data?**
The current version does not support calling gene fusions from DNA data as translocation calling is not supported yet. However, support for translocations will be available in the future. 

**Can I use this pipeline to detect gene fusion using cDNA data?**
cDNA data is not supported
